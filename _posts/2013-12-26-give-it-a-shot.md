This must be the fourth or fifth time I've started blogging. Perhaps this one will survive, perhaps it won't.

## The Tech

Jekyll. Do I really need to say more? It lets me write my posts in markdown inside of vim, generates a static site, and lets me manage the entire thing with git. It really does feel like a tool built by hackers and for hackers. Wordpress, Joomla, and the larger content management systems in general are great at what they do and have been a massive help for some projects such as [Rainforest Partnership's website](http://rainforestpartnership.org/) but are overkill for something so simple.

There are no PHP configs to manage, no SQL database to backup, nothing. Just plain text on my laptop and plain text on the server. Jekyll makes development a breeze with its built in server. My development environment is vim, firefox, and a git repo.
