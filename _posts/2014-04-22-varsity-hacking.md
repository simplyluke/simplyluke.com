# Varsity Hacking

Today the biggest constraint for most high school students with an interest in coding and technology is not motivation, nor is it resources to learn; it's a lack of time and a lack of structure behind learning to code. A thought I've been toying with over the last few weeks is whether structuring coding similar to the way athletes are trained in high school would work. Plenty of teenagers commit tons of time to structured varsity sports, so I propose structured varsity hacking.

## Training

* Sports meet every day, coding should happen every day
* Have structure and goals, athletes don't exercise just to exercise. They have goals.


## Competitions

* Enter the hackathon
* Multiple schools
* Remote
* judging is more standardized than other hackathons

## Benefits

* School district acceptance/understanding of time involved
* Excused absences for events
* More exciting model than classroom based approach
*
