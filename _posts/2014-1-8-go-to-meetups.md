Tonight I went to a meetup for [Austin Python](http://www.meetup.com/austinpython/). It had been several months since I last went to a meetup but I decided to go. This was my first meetup with the group. I'm sure I was the youngest member of the audience.

The community was welcoming, the talks were interesting and educational, the pizza was good, and the conversations I had with programmers opened my eyes to some new aspects of Python and development. There were people of all skill levels present. People that have been writing incredible code for decades were helping people that had been coding for a couple of months. At no point did I feel a sense of elitism or judgment towards those with less experience. 

That's been the consistent feeling I've had at most meetups. Everyone is there to enjoy themselves, meet other people, and learn new things. Meetups provide a relaxed environment that fosters great community and collaboration. And in Austin, there's no shortage of them for whatever your interests may be. Browsing the local [meetup.com](http://www.meetup.com/) listings show countless groups for everything from photography to hiking to API development.

I think anyone who's trying to learn new technology or become more active in their local tech scene should make every effort to get out to a couple of meetups and find ones they like. This includes teenage coders and new coders. Working with other people will teach you so much faster than learning on your own. There's a great meetup I went to last year [specifically dedicated to teaching people python](http://www.meetup.com/AustinLearnPython/). Even though I knew a lot about the language going in I learned much more than I had expected and met some really cool programmers that have taught me a ton about coding.

The day after I get back in country from a school trip next week I'm going to a meetup for [Ruby noobies](http://www.meetup.com/makersquare/events/140778312/). What meetups are you going to? Let me know on twitter: [@cenhyperion](https://twitter.com/cenhyperion/)
