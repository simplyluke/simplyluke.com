I participated in the Facebook Texas Regional Hackathon with Canzhi Ye, Coulton Vento, and Kevin Wu. They're all incredibly talented guys and our app, [dormmates](http://dormmat.es) won third place. Working with them was a great experience, and we're planning on working together again at a SXSW Hackathon. Facebook has an incredible Austin office and did a great job hosting the event; there was plenty of good food and lots of caffeine in a very cool downtown office.

We landed a very cool office early in the morning after staying up all night coding. There was no sleep.

Big thanks to my team and Facebook. We're planning on potentially launching the app publicly soon.
