    <h1>Luke Wright</h1>
    <p>
    I'm a computer science student at <a href="http://www.utexas.edu/" target="_blank">The University of Texas at Austin.</a>I'm currently a part time software engineering intern at <a href="https://spredfast.com/" target="_blank">Spredfast</a> while enrolled in classes. I spent the summers of 2017 and 2018 there full-time as well. I've also done a good bit of work for some <a href="https://rainforestpartnership.org/" target="_blank">non-profits</a> I like <a href="http://balloonchallenge.org/" target="_blank">a lot</a>. In the past I've worked with <a href="http://hnhdigitalagency.com/" target="_blank">H&H Digital Agency</a> doing full stack web development.
    </p>
    <p>Web Development is my bread and butter. When I'm not on my laptop, I'm the captain of <a href="http://texaswaterski.org/">The University of Texas Water Ski Team</a>.</p>
    <p>
      Some technologies I've enjoyed working with in particular, or am currently learning.

    <ul>
      <li>Ruby on Rails</li>
      <li>Python - particularly with the Flask microframework</li>
      <li>Scala</li>
      <li>Sass</li>
    </ul>

      I enjoy meeting new people and working on interesting projects, so feel free to reach out.
